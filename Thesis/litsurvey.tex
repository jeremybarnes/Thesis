\section{Learning Theory}

\begin{itemize}

\item	\textbf{Cherkassky and Mulier, 1998 \cite{Cherkassky98}}
	This book contains a broad overview of the topic of ``learning
	from data''.  Covers classical statistical methods as well as
	statistical learning theory, including descriptions and
	analysis of many algorithms.  Contains sufficient detail to
	allow algorithms to be implemented from the descriptions
	provided.

\item	\textbf{Vapnik, 1998 \cite{Vapnik98}}
	A very detailed book.  Broadly organised into three sections:
	``\emph{Theory of learning and generalisation}'', covering the
	learning problem, ERM, SRM and convergence issues;
	``\emph{Support vector estimation of functions}'', covering
	support vector machines, and ``\emph{Statistical foundation of
	learning theory}'' concerning convergence of frequencies to
	probabilities and means to expectations.  Contains rigorous
	proofs wherever possible.  More detailed than needed for this
	project.
