\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my appreciation for the contributions made to
this project by the following people:

\begin{itemize}
\item	\emph{Peter Bartlett} for very patiently straightening out the
	many inconsistencies and gaps in my knowledge, and then
	showing me a much easier avenue of enquiry.

\item	\emph{Gunnar R\"{a}tsch} for giving me another perspective on
	my proposed algorithms.

\item	\emph{Mum and Dad} for proofreading my manuscript and
	providing me with many helpful suggestions.

\item	The maintainers of the datasets that I have used.

\item	\emph{Bob Williamson} for an interesting, challenging and
	rewarding project; and for putting far more time and effort
	into supervision than obliged to.
\end{itemize}
