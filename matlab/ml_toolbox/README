If you have trouble making the MEX files:

* Ensure that $MATLAB/bin is in your path

* Set $MEX_EXTN to whatever the extension for MEX files is on
  your platform, INCLUDING the period (.mexlx for Linux, .dll
  for Windows, etc).  To find this, have a look in the 
  $MATLAB/toolbox/matlab/elfun directory.  There should be a
  file called complex.<something> there, where <something> is
  not "m".  The extension of this file is the MEX_EXTN
  environment variable.

Otherwise, drop me a line.
